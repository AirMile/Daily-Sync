# styles/custom.css

**Purpose:** Custom stylesheet for additional styling and theme customizations beyond the main CSS variables.

## Current Status
**Note:** This file is currently empty, serving as a placeholder for future custom styling needs.

## Intended Usage

### Custom Styling Layer
This file serves as the secondary styling layer for:
- **Component-specific customizations** that don't fit in main.css
- **Override styling** for specific use cases
- **Additional utility classes** not covered in main.css
- **Experimental styling** before integration into main.css

### Planned Content

#### Component Customizations
- **Specialized component styling** that extends beyond base variables
- **Component-specific animations** and transitions
- **Complex layout rules** for specific components
- **Visual enhancements** like gradients, complex shadows, or effects

#### Responsive Enhancements
- **Mobile-specific adjustments** for better mobile experience
- **Tablet optimizations** for medium screen sizes
- **Desktop enhancements** for larger screens
- **Print-specific styling** for diary export functionality

#### Theme Extensions
- **Seasonal themes** or special event styling
- **Accessibility enhancements** like high-contrast mode
- **Custom color schemes** beyond the default palette
- **Dark mode implementations** (if added in future)

### Architecture Guidelines

#### Variable-First Approach
Even custom styles should:
- **Use CSS variables from main.css** as foundation
- **Define new CSS variables** for custom values when needed
- **Avoid hardcoded values** following project requirements
- **Maintain consistency** with existing design system

#### Organization Structure
When content is added, organize by:
```css
/* Component-specific customizations */
.mood-selector-custom { }

/* Utility classes */
.custom-animation { }

/* Responsive overrides */
@media (max-width: 768px) { }

/* Theme variations */
.dark-theme { }
```

## Integration Points
- **Loaded after main.css** in index.html for proper cascade
- **Components reference** custom classes when needed
- **JavaScript can toggle** custom theme classes
- **Build process** can combine with main.css if needed

## Development Notes
- **Keep additions minimal** - prefer extending main.css variables
- **Document new patterns** that could be moved to main.css
- **Test across devices** when adding responsive customizations
- **Maintain accessibility** standards for any visual enhancements

This file provides flexibility for custom styling while maintaining the CSS variable architecture established in main.css.
