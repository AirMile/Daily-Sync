# modules/questions.js

**Purpose:** Question bank management and selection logic for daily reflection questions.

## Current Status
**Note:** This module is currently a placeholder with TODO comments. Implementation planned for future phases.

## Planned Functionality

### Question Selection Algorithm
- **Mood-Based Filtering:** Select questions appropriate for current mood level
- **Activity Integration:** Consider selected activities when choosing questions
- **Smart Rotation:** Avoid repeating recent questions to maintain engagement
- **Contextual Relevance:** Ensure questions match user's emotional and activity context

### Question Management
- **Bank Management:** Organize and categorize question sets
- **Dynamic Selection:** Real-time question selection based on user state
- **Quality Control:** Ensure selected questions maintain flow and coherence
- **Difficulty Balancing:** Mix different types of reflection questions

### Answer Processing
- **Input Validation:** Ensure answer quality meets minimum requirements
- **Storage Integration:** Process and store answers with metadata
- **Analysis Preparation:** Format answers for future insight generation
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitor completion and engagement metrics

## Integration Points
- **Config.js:** Uses QUESTIONS configuration data
- **App.js:** Provides question logic for application flow
- **Storage.js:** Handles persistence of questions and answers
- **QuestionCard Component:** Supplies questions to UI component
- **AI-Diary.js:** Provides processed questions for diary generation

## Implementation Notes
This module will centralize:
- Question selection algorithms
- Answer validation and processing
- Question rotation and variety management
- Integration between mood/activities and appropriate questions

Currently, basic question functionality is implemented in config.js and handled by the QuestionCard component, but advanced logic will be centralized here.
