# modules/ai-diary.js

**Purpose:** AI diary generator that creates readable diary entries from collected mood, activity, and response data.

## Current Status
**Note:** This module is currently a placeholder with TODO comments. Will implement template-based "AI" simulation (no actual AI) as specified in project requirements.

## Planned Functionality

### Template-Based Generation
- **Hardcoded Templates:** Pre-written templates that simulate AI-generated content
- **Data Integration:** Insert user data (mood, activities, answers) into templates
- **Personalization:** Customize templates based on user patterns and preferences
- **Natural Language:** Generate human-readable diary entries from structured data

### Daily Summary Generation
- **Mood Integration:** Incorporate mood level and description into diary text
- **Activity Narrative:** Weave selected activities into cohesive daily story
- **Answer Integration:** Include question responses in natural diary format
- **Contextual Awareness:** Adjust tone and content based on overall day assessment

### Pattern Recognition
- **Weekly Insights:** Generate weekly summaries identifying patterns
- **Trend Awareness:** Include observations about mood/activity trends
- **Progress Acknowledgment:** Recognize improvements and positive patterns
- **Gentle Guidance:** Suggest areas for potential focus or improvement

### Personalized Suggestions
- **Question Recommendations:** Suggest new questions based on user history
- **Activity Suggestions:** Recommend activities that historically improve mood
- **Reflection Prompts:** Generate personalized prompts for deeper reflection
- **Goal Integration:** Align suggestions with user's wellbeing goals

## Template Categories

### Mood-Based Templates
- **Positive Days:** Templates for good/amazing mood levels
- **Neutral Days:** Templates for okay/average mood levels  
- **Challenging Days:** Supportive templates for difficult mood levels
- **Mixed Days:** Templates for complex emotional experiences

### Activity-Based Variations
- **Work-Heavy Days:** Templates for productivity-focused days
- **Social Days:** Templates emphasizing social connections
- **Self-Care Days:** Templates for relaxation and personal time
- **Active Days:** Templates for exercise and physical activities

## Integration Points
- **Storage.js:** Retrieves historical data for pattern analysis
- **App.js:** Provides diary generation for completion view
- **Config.js:** Uses question and activity data for context
- **DiaryView Component:** Displays generated diary content

## Implementation Notes
This module will use:
- Template libraries with placeholders for user data
- Simple rule-based logic to select appropriate templates
- String interpolation to insert personalized content
- No actual AI - purely template-based simulation

The "AI diary" creates the illusion of intelligent content generation while using predetermined templates and basic data processing.
