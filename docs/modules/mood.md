# modules/mood.js

**Purpose:** Mood selection logic and processing for the Daily Sync application.

## Current Status
**Note:** This module is currently a placeholder with TODO comments. Implementation planned for future phases.

## Planned Functionality

### Mood Processing Logic
- **5-Level Scale:** Process mood values from 1 (Terrible) to 5 (Amazing)
- **Emoji Integration:** Handle mood representation with corresponding emojis
- **Validation:** Ensure mood selection meets application requirements

### Question Filtering
- **Mood-Based Questions:** Filter questions based on selected mood level
- **Positive/Negative/Neutral:** Categorize questions by emotional context
- **Adaptive Questioning:** Show relevant questions based on emotional state

### Statistical Integration
- **Trend Calculations:** Process mood data for trend analysis
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify mood patterns over time
- **Data Aggregation:** Prepare mood data for statistics view

## Integration Points
- **Config.js:** Uses MOODS configuration for mood level definitions
- **App.js:** Provides mood processing logic for main application
- **Storage.js:** Handles persistence of mood data and trends
- **Components:** Supports mood selector component with processing logic

## Implementation Notes
This module will contain business logic for:
- Mood validation and normalization
- Question selection algorithms based on mood
- Mood trend calculations for insights
- Integration with storage and statistics systems

Currently, mood processing is handled directly in the MoodSelector component and App.js, but will be centralized here in future iterations.
